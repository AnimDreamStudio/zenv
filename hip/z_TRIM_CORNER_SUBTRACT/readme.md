# z_TRIM_CORNER_SUBTRACT

replaced polyextrude with skin to insure contingous quad geo for the subtraction mesh so doesnt add unneeded geo during boolean . this method however needs to be reversed sometimes , maybe can use the input +-axis params to determine when this happens . need to clean up / change how the starting axis measuring
